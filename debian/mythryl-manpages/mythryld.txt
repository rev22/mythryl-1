! SYNOPSIS

''mythryld''

''mythryld'' [ /runtime system args/ ] [ /options/ ] [ /files/ ]

''mythryld'' -h

! DESCRIPTION

''mythryld'', invoked without any argument, starts an interactive
Mythryl session.

As the user inputs Mythryl statements, they are immediately compiled,
evaluated, and have their result pretty-printed back to the user.

This makes it useful to quickly execute code, experiment with the
language, or the compiler functionality.

''mythryld'' may also be invoked by the shorthand command ''my''.

With options ''-x'', ''-e'' and ''-E'', ''mythryld'' executes
arbitrary Mythryl expressions.

! OPTIONS

''-E /expression/''::
	Print result of expression.

''-e /expression/''::
	Print result of expression and quit.

''-x /expression/''::
	Print result of expression followed by a newline, then quit.

''-h''::
	Display more help on the available options.

! EXAMPLE

''rlwrap mythryld''::
	Starts mythryld with command line history and editing
	provided by ''rlwrap'' (1).  ''rlwrap'' is not provided by the
	Mythryl compiler suite but can be installed separately.
