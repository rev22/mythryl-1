! SYNOPSIS

''mythryl'' /script/

''#!/usr/bin/mythryl''

! DESCRIPTION

The command ''mythryl'' executes Mythryl scripts,
compiling them on the fly.

It can be invoked by Mythryl scripts using a shebang
line, ''#!/usr/bin/mythryl'', as the start of the script.

For an interactive Mythryl session invoke instead ''mythryld'' (1).

To compile mythryl source code into an executable file you can use
