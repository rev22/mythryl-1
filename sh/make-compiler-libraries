# Recompile 'mythryl_compiler_compiler_for_this_Platform'
# (if necessary) and then run it.


# First, select compiler image to use.
#
# bin/mythryld is the "executable" heap image containing
# the compiled Mythryl code for the compiler etc.
#
# We may have up to four versions of it floating around:
#
#     bin/mythryld-bootstrap   The downloaded seed version used to get started.
#     bin/mythryld-bare        The first locally-compiled version, containing just the essentials.
#     bin/mythryld.previous    The previous version of bin/mythryld -- first fallback if bin/mythryld is missing or broken.
#     bin/mythryld             The most recently compiled version, containing all goodies requested via sh/addglue
#
# Use any of the above, in
# reverse order of preference:

if [ -f bin/mythryld ]; then
    mythryld=bin/mythryld
else
    if [ -f bin/mythryld-bare ]; then
        mythryld=bin/mythryld-bare
    else
	if [ -f bin/mythryld.previous ]; then
	    mythryld=bin/mythryld.previous
	else
	    if [ -f bin/mythryld-bootstrap ]; then
		mythryld=bin/mythryld-bootstrap

		echo "bin/mythryld.previous does not exist."
